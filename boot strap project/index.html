                    Flowers, also known as blooms and blossoms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants. Typically, they are structured in four circular levels around the end of a stalk. These include: sepals, which are modified leaves that support the flower; petals, often designed to attract pollinators; male stamens, where pollen is presented; and female gynoecia, where pollen is received and its movement is facilitated to the egg. When flowers are arranged in a group, they are known collectively as an inflorescence.

The development of flowers is a complex and important part in the life cycles of flowering plants. In most plants, flowers are able to produce sex cells of both sexes. Pollen, which can produce the male sex cells, is transported between the male and female parts of flowers in pollination. Pollination can occur between different plants, as in cross-pollination, or between flowers on the same plant or even the same flower, as in self-pollination. Pollen movement may be caused by animals, such as birds and insects, or non-living things like wind and water. The colour and structure of flowers assist in the pollination process.

After pollination, the sex cells are fused together in the process of fertilisation, which is a key step in sexual reproduction. Through cellular and nuclear divisions, the resulting cell grows into a seed, which contains structures to assist in the future plant's survival and growth. At the same time, the female part of the flower forms into a fruit, and the other floral structures die. The function of fruit is to protect the seed and aid in its dispersal away from the mother plant. Seeds can be dispersed by living things, such as birds who eat the fruit and distribute the seeds when they defecate. Non-living things like wind and water can also help to disperse the seeds.

Flowers first evolved between 150 and 190 million years ago, in the Jurassic. Plants with flowers replaced non-flowering plants in many ecosystems, as a result of flowers' superior reproductive effectiveness. In the study of plant classification, flowers are a key feature used to differentiate plants. For thousands of years humans have used flowers for a variety of other purposes, including: decoration, medicine, food, and perfumes. In human cultures, flowers are used symbolically and feature in art, literature, religious practices, ritual, and festivals. All aspects of flowers, including size, shape, colour, and smell, show immense diversity across flowering plants. They range in size from 0.1 mm (1⁄250 inch) to 1 metre (3.3 ft), and in this way range from highly reduced and understated, to dominating the structure of the plant. Plants with flowers dominate the majority of the world's ecosystems, and themselves range from tiny orchids and major crop plants to large trees.

Etymology
In botany, flowers are defined as the reproductive structures of angiosperms (flowering plants),[1] while cones are regarded as the gymnosperm equivalent.[2][note 1] Bloom is similarly defined, but may also be used to describe the collective of flowers on a plant, as in the phrase: covered with bloom.[4] Flower is also commonly used to describe the whole of a plant that produces flowers.[4]

Flower entered Middle English via Old French flor from earlier Latin flōs, flōris and before that Proto-Italic *flōs, all of which had the same meaning 'flower'.[5][6] The spelling flour was more common in English until the 17th century, when it became specialised to mean "ground grain" — originally an instance of figurative flower meaning "best part; finest".[7] The Old English word for flower was blossom,[8] which is still used today, but refers especially to the flowers of edible fruit trees, and not to the whole flowering plant.[4] Flower, bloom, and blossom are all cognates and are derived from the Proto-Indo-European word *bʰleh₃ōs ('blossoming').[6] Both bloom and blossom refer to flowers as well as the state of flowering; as in the phrases: in bloom or in blossom.[4]

Function
The main purpose of a flower is reproduction of the individual,[9] aiding in the survival of the species.[10] Flowers not only produce spores, which become gametophytes that produce sex cells, leading to fertilised cells, but also develop and help disseminate seeds.[11] Sexual reproduction between plants results in evolutionary adaptation, which improves species survival. Plants favour cross-pollination because it promotes the joining of sex cells from genetically distinct plants of the same species, thereby increasing genetic diversity. Facilitating this process is a key function of flowers and is often reflected in their form and structure.[11] Features designed to attract pollinators are among the most common adaptations.[12]
