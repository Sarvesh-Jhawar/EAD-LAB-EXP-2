## 1. Frontend Development

### 1.1. Core Web Fundamentals

Experiments focusing on fundamental web technologies and JavaScript logic.

* **HTML/CSS Exercises (`week1 and week2`):** Basic structuring and styling exercises in HTML and CSS.
* **Chessboard Layout (`week3`):** Implementation of a two-color chessboard using HTML and CSS.
* **Calculator (`week4/Calculator`):** A fundamental calculator application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* **JavaScript Functions (`theory/Function Exercises`):** Practice exercises focusing on JavaScript function implementation and logic.

### 1.2. Bootstrap Integration

* **Bootstrap Project (`boot strap project`):** Experiments demonstrating the use of the **Bootstrap CSS framework** for rapid and responsive UI development.

### 1.3. React Projects

Experiments utilizing the React JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* **First React Project (`FirstReactProject`):** Initial setup using the **React + Vite** template, configured with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint rules.
* **React Timer (`React-Timer and GetData/Timer.js`):** A functional component demonstrating **state management** (`useState`) and **side effects** (`useEffect`) to create a digital timer with **Start, Pause, and Reset** controls.
* **Password Strength Checker (`password-strength-checker`):** A project focused on form validation and real-time user feedback on password strength.
* **Second React App (`second-react-app`):** Contains miscellaneous component experiments, including a `Toggle` switch, a `Movie` component (likely for displaying fetched data or lists), and `Forminput` component(s).

## 2. Backend and Database Development

### 2.1. Student CRUD API (`student-crud-api`)

A backend application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (via Mongoose) to manage student records.

* **API Framework**: **Express.js**.
* **Database**: **MongoDB** (with Mongoose integration for schema-based modeling).
* **Functionality**: Implements basic **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete endpoints for student data.
* **Routes**: Accessible at `/api/students`.

### 2.2. JWT Authentication API (`JWT`)

A service dedicated to implementing user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens.

* **Core Feature**: Token generation and validation using **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.
* **Framework**: **Express.js**.
* **Routes**: Authentication logic handled at `/api/auth`.
* **Security**: Includes middleware for verifying tokens (`verifyToken.js`).

## 3. Other Experiments

* **Google Maps Integration (`GMAP integration`):** Code for embedding and interacting with the Google Maps API within a web application.
* **MongoDB Replica Set Documentation (`Mongo DB replica.docx`):** Document detailing the setup, configuration, and concepts of a MongoDB Replica Set for high availability.
